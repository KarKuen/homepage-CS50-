                                    <p>In Robotics, we built and coded our own robots to accomplish specific tasks (such as line tracing and color detection). Addtionally,

                                    <p>After my first year in polytechnic; during my <b>holidays</b> once again, a friend of mine, who was going to study game design, wanted to create a game with me.
                                    However, we were both inexperienced and inadequate. Therefore, I took this chance to <b>learn
                                    how to code games within python</b> as that was the only language I've learnt and was comfortable in. I scourred the
                                    internet and found this amazing book.</p>

                                    time and immediately jumped into Godot. <b>Watching online tutorials</b> of how to use this game engine. However, after
                                    a week in, we decided to <b>stop and drop the project</b> for now because we knew our skills and knowledge were still

                                    <p>During my second year of polytechnic, I decided to take up the Fundamentals of Programming as my elective.
                                    While they taught python, I thought it was a good opportunity to familiarise myself more with the language and
                                    possibly learning new things.</p>

                                    manipulate excel sheets.</p>

                                    <p>For our final project, we had to program a log_in page that returned the corresponding data for the log_in_id within
                                    a team of 4. It was also the <b>first time I coded an entire project with a team</b> which was a valuable experience.</p>
